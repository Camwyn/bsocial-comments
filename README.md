================

The featured comments from [bSocial](https://github.com/misterbisson/bsocial) are moved here and we're adding other goodness.

## Usage

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Use the default options, or filter `go_config` to return the options you want (when the second arg = `bsocial-comments`).
3. Have fun, feature some comments!
